      <description>In C++, we use the class std::string to store a sequence of characters, where we can perform various member functions and operators on the characters.
To use the std::string class mentioned above, simply include its header at the top of your .cpp file. (Note that the third line allows us to use identifiers in the std namespace without using the prefix std::)
#include &amp;lt;iostream&amp;gt;#include &amp;lt;string&amp;gt;using namespace std; Normally, we would initialize a string variable in the following way:</description>

      <description>In C++, the arguments of a function can be passed by 3 methods: pass by value, pass by pointer and pass by reference
callee: A function that is called by another
caller: A function that calls another function
Â Pass by value This is the method is usually used when we want to perform some calculations in a function using the value of the parameters. When we call a function that takes in a single parameter with pass by value, a copy of the caller function&amp;rsquo;s variable is passed into the callee function as an argument, where it will become a local variable.</description>
