      <description>In C++, the arguments of a function can be passed by 3 methods: pass by value, pass by pointer and pass by reference.
callee: A function that is called by another caller: A function that calls another function
Pass by value This is the method that is most commonly used. When we call a function that takes in a single parameter with pass by value, a copy of the caller function&amp;rsquo;s variable is passed into the callee function as an argument, where it will become a local variable.</description>
