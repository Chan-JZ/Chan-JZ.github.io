        <description>&lt;p&gt;In this summer, I spend a lot of time in doing LeetCode questions to improve my problem solving and software developing skills. However, it is normal for us to forget some questions that we have done. Therefore, in this post, I will make a summary about all tricks of approaching LeetCode questions that I have found. In general, I will include some templates, observations of solving a bunch of similar LeetCode questions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
