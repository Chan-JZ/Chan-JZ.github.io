        <description>&lt;p&gt;This post is about one of the tasks of my Summer Research. For this task, we had to install Hyperstyle (a powerful code quality analyzer) from the paper &amp;lsquo;Hyperstyle: A Tool for Assessing the Code Quality of Solutions to Programming Assignments&amp;rsquo;. During the installation process, we realized that it is a bit tricky especially for Windows users. Therefore, we decided to make a documentation that includes clear, concise steps and issues that we encountered as well as how we resolved them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
